01) WHAT IS NPM?
    --NPM does'nt stand for node package manager

02) WHY DO WE USE NPM?
   --Because a react app is powered by a lot of things ( i.e suppose we have to bundle things up, we have to minfy things
   ,we have to remove console log, wehave to optimize app etc..) for we need lot of helper pakages and those helper pakages come inside NPM  

***npm init** => Package-jason



03) npm install -D parcel // here -D stands for dev dependency(i.e we want to use these for developer side not in production)

04) Difference between caret(^) and tilda(~)?
        -- (^) => THIS ALLOW FOR AUTO UPDATATION 

05) package-lock => lock the version of  a dependency.
                 => NEVER PUT PACKAGE-LOCK IN GITIGNORE
                 => it has hash of the package version to maintain the integrity


06) Node_Modules => It is where all dependencies are installed when we run npm install in our project.
                    Or we can say it act like a database for  storing all packages that are used by our application.
                 => Never put  your node_modules folder into git repository, because our **package-lock.json** any one ca regenerate the node_modules

07) npm install react => we want react for global not only for developer side but also in server side 
    npm i react-dom               
    
    ** BUT WHY NOT CDN ** =>  Because CDNs do not provide any way to update or manage packages
                          => and more over cdn is on another server which makes the render of website slow
                             where as nodemodules will be at servers so makes the website fast.

08) PARCEL IMPORTANCE


   * Created A Server
   * HMR-Hot Module Replacement, Parcle do  that by default while developing an application.
   * File Watcher Agorithm - C++
   * Parcel-cache
   * dist folder- 
   * MINIFY
   * bundle
   * cleaning our code
   * Dev and Production Build
   * Super Fast Build Algorithm
   * Image Optimization
   * Caching while development
   * Compression
   * Compatible with older version of browser**
   * HTTPS  on  localhost:1234/index.html
   * Manages Port Number
   * Consistent Hashing Algorthim
   * Zero Config 

  
   ** npx parcel entry_point_of_your project(her it is index.html)**
   ###WE SHOULD PUT PARCEL-CACHE IN  .gitignore BECAUSE any thing which can be generate in the server will be puch into gitignore


09) Why React is Fast?

10) Difference between dev dependencies And dependencies?


11) browserlist => 
  

***### TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES ###*** 
        
         OR(we can say)

***### DEPENDENCIES TREE ###*** 
//We have our package manager which take care of the transitive dependencies of our code
